Emoji App,

Summer Time theme Emoji App - make it your own!
A simple JS app

The purpose of the app - a fun game

Check out this demo LIVE:https://michaljakubhoppe.github.io/JS-Emoji-App/

how to play:
go to emojipedia.org and copy and paste your favourite emojis in the input bar, hit of the available button in the app to either add or substract the emoji from/to the beginning or end of the display. Decide which emoji goes first and which next.

by creating it I've learnt:
DOM manipulation,
if else statements,
for loops,
array methods,
functions,
how to logically build a functioning app.

Quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
